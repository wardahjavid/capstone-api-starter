### **Easyshop Application**
##About Project
EasyShop is a Java Spring Boot REST API for a simple e-commerce store. It allows users to browse product categories, 
search and filter products, register/login to get a JWT token, manage their profile, and manage their shopping cart. 
Intended users are customers who want to shop and admins who manage products and categories.

## User Stories

As a shopper, I want to view products in a specific category so that I can narrow down what I’m shopping for.
As a shopper, I want to search products with filters (category, min price, max price, subcategory/genre) so that I can find what I want faster.
As a shopper, I want to view a single product by ID so that I can see details before buying.
As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can log in and access protected features.
As a user, I want to log in and receive a JWT token so that I can access my cart and profile.
As a logged-in user, I want to view my profile so that I can see my saved information.
As a logged-in user, I want to update my profile so that my contact and address info stays current.
As a logged-in user, I want to view my shopping cart so that I can see what I plan to buy.
As a logged-in user, I want to add products to my cart so that I can purchase them later.
As a logged-in user, I want to update quantities in my cart so that I can adjust my order.
As a logged-in user, I want to clear my cart so that I can start over.

## Prerequisites
IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate)
Java SDK (your cohort’s required version, e.g., Java 17)
MySQL Server (running locally)
A database client (optional): MySQL Workbench
Insomnia (for testing endpoints)

## Future Work
Add a checkout and orders feature so a user can place an order using the items currently in their shopping cart.\
Add the ability to remove a single product from the cart instead of clearing the entire cart, improve product searching by adding pagination and sorting.
Enforce validation rules on product, category, and profile inputs to ensure data is accurate and complete.
